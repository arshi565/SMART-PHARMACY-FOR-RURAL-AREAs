If medicines are not stored properly they may not work in the way they were intended, and so pose a potential risk to the health and well being of the person receiving the medicine. Medicines should be stored under conditions which ensure that their quality is maintained. The temperature and humidity of storage are one of the most important factors that can affect the stability of medicine. Static buildup is a significant effect of relative humidity levels reducing to below 45%. The buildup of static charges can dry out medications, impacting the intended performance of any solvents used in production. The excess static can also make products to dry out and crumble, or stick together, causing issues during pressing and packaging of tablets.
